                As recognized providers of quality continuing education for over 40 years, we are experts at assembling
                the
                appropriate stakeholders, conducting effective needs assessments, and producing, delivering and
                evaluating
                innovative and cost-effective education and training in multiple modalities. We enjoy a position of
                trust
                with many professional accreditation boards in the state who have accepted the AHEC contact hour/CEU as
                a
                "seal of approval" for educational programs. We are involved with program planning from the beginning
                in
                order to ensure the programs we provide credit for are meeting established guidelines for audience
                assessment, program objectives and evaluation, as well as faculty requirements for unbiased,
                evidence-based
                presentations. If you are interested in partnering with Greensboro AHEC we look forward to learning
                more
                about your educational activity and exploring ways we can support you to achieve the best possible
                outcomes
                for the learners.
