                <p class="h4 text-muted">Office of Regional Primary Care Education</p>
                In response to a shift toward community-based primary care education, the North Carolina Area Health
                Education Centers (AHEC) Program has established an Office of Regional Primary Care Education (ORPCE)
                in each of the state's nine AHECs. The purpose of the ORPCE is to facilitate and enhance high quality
                health profession student training in community settings. Students in medical, physician assistant,
                nurse practitioner and Pharm D programs in North Carolina schools are currently being precepted by
                health professionals in the Greensboro AHEC region.

                <p class="h3 text-muted">Housing</p>
                The Office of Regional Primary Care Education (ORPCE) provides housing for health professions students
                during their community clinical experiences.

                <p class="h4 text-muted">Follow the Steps Below to Obtain Greensboro AHEC Housing</p>
                <p></p>
                <strong>Step 1</strong>
                <p></p>
                Complete the <strong>GAHEC ORPCE Student Housing Agreement</strong> form found below in the "Links" box. This form can
                be submitted online, faxed or mailed to our office along with the security deposit. Fax (336-832-2851).
                <p></p>
                <strong>Step 2</strong>
                <p></p>
                <strong>A $50.00 security deposit is required for all housing applicants.</strong> You may either send in a check or pay
                by credit card.
                <p></p>
               <strong> By Check:</strong> Payable to Greensboro AHEC
                Send to ATTN: ORPCE, 1200 N. Elm Street, Greensboro, NC 27401. Please include your rotation dates on
                the memo line of the check.
                By Credit Card: Call Tonya Crawford Baldwin at (336) 832-8566.
                <p></p>
                <strong>Step 3</strong>
                <p></p>
                You must complete an online housing application. All requests for AHEC student housing must be made
                through the statewide MyAHEC website at https://my.ncahec.net. The site will instruct you to create an
                online account and you can select the AHEC region(s) where you need housing. This process requires that
                you apply for your own housing; a school/course coordinator will not be able to apply for housing on
                your behalf.
                <p></p>
                <p class="h4 text-muted">HOUSING IS ON A FIRST-COME, FIRST-SERVED BASIS.</p>
                <p></p>
                As housing is limited, please submit these forms as soon as possible after your rotation assignment has
                been scheduled and is definite. All forms and payment must be received in the Greensboro AHEC office
                before housing can be confirmed and keys issued. You will receive a confirmation of housing by email
                approximately 3-4 weeks before your rotation begins, provided that all forms and deposits have been
                received.
                <p></p>
                <p class="h4 text-muted">YOUR SECURITY DEPOSIT WILL BE FORFEITED IF:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Housing is not cancelled within 72 hours of your rotation beginning date and you are considered as a
                no-show</li>
                <li>Keys are not properly returned at the end of rotation</li>
                <li>All requirements listed in GAHEC Housing Agreement are not adhered to</li>
                </ul>
                <p></p>
                Please note: We will not process the security deposit if the items on the housing agreement are adhered
                to. Checks and credit card information will be destroyed and payments will not be processed.
                <p></p>

                Course coordinators placing students in our region for clinical rotations of approved ORPCE courses
                need to notify our office of these rotations as soon as possible. The<strong> NC AHEC Program Community Primary
                Care Rotation Form </strong>is found below in the "Links" box and should be submitted online or faxed to our
                office on each student who is precepted by one of the preceptors within our region. This ensures that
                the preceptor will be reimbursed for precepting the student.
