            <p></p>
        The <strong> AHEC RN Refresher Program</strong> has been active since the early 1990s. It provides a means for nurses with
        inactive licensure for five or more years to reactivate their license with the North Carolina Board of Nursing.
        The program is also available to nurses with active licenses who have not worked in a clinical area for some
        time and would like to update their knowledge and skills. It includes 24 self-paced online modules and covers a
        variety of topics from contemporary nursing to care of the medical surgical patient. Once completed
        successfully, the RN Coordinator organizes the clinical experience, which includes 160 hours with a registered
        nurse preceptor on a medical surgical unit.
