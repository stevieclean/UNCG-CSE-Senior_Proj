Project definition: We need to update this app, develop additional functionality (find nearest services, autodial,
calendar appointment, prescreen, use text, connect with live person, etc.). The app is also currently under-utilized

From Previous iOS attempts
A brief summary of the iOS architecture and history:
The iOS version was developed using Dropsource with final coding in Xcode/Swift 4, which can be provided as a
starting point. All the graphics were designed and produced in Adobe software products: Illustrator,
Photoshop, and Fireworks. The last “build” in the simulator is available at this link: CURE which may be readily
viewed on your Apple iPhone.
 
You will see from the simulated app that it is very similar to the Android version, which was designed to be a
compilation of resources and webpages. The app was submitted to the Apple review process two times. The
final submission and second iteration included an interactive, functioning Action Planner where the user could
create a list and an APNS (Apple notification service). These additions were made as an effort to add more
functionality to the initial rejection which was said to mimic a website. It wasn’t enough.
 
The iOS app must include features, content, and UI that elevates it beyond a repackaged website, or it will be
rejected. So, the challenge is not to recreate the current Android app functionality. We need a new concept
with creative ideas for the CURE app that elevates it above a compilation of webpages. This would appear to
be an excellent design and development challenge for Information System students and the capstone team in
the spring.
Deliverables: iOS adaptation and expansion of current Android app

Future updates provided and changes will be reflected in documentation folder.
