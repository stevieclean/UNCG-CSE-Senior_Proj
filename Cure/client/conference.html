            <p class="h5"> Partner with Greensboro AHEC and Let Us Do the Work </p>
            As recognized providers of quality continuing education for over 40 years, we are experts at assembling the appropriate stakeholders, conducting effective needs assessments, and producing, delivering and evaluating innovative and cost-effective education and training in multiple modalities.  We enjoy a position of trust with many professional accreditation boards in the state who have accepted the AHEC contact hour/CEU as a "seal of approval" for educational programs. We are involved with program planning from the beginning in order to ensure the programs we provide credit for are meeting established guidelines for audience assessment, program objectives and evaluation, as well as faculty requirements for unbiased, evidence-based presentations. If  you are interested in partnering with Greensboro AHEC we look forward to learning more about your educational activity and exploring ways we can support you to achieve the best possible outcomes for the learners.
